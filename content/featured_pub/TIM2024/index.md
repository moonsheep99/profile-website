title: A Robust and Fast GNSS-Inertial-LiDAR Odometry With INS-Centric Multiple Modalities by IESKF
summary: This article presents a robust and fast odometry with multiple modalities. Our framework is based on two subsystems:the GNSS-IMU subsystem estimates coarse states and provides global constraints, the LiDAR-IMU subsystem refines states and constructs the 3-D map. The state estimation is performed by IESKF without interruption even if partial sensor fails. Moreover, a fast and dynamic frame transformation method and distributed backward propagation are designed for linking world-frame states with global measurements and coping with asynchronism data.
