title: A LiDAR Inertial Odometry Based on Adaptive Voxel Grid Filter for Indoor and Outdoor Mixed Environments
summary: In this paper, we present a LiDAR inertial odometry based on an adaptive voxel grid filter to cope with point density variations in indoor and outdoor mixed environments. Benefiting from the adaptive voxel grid filter we proposed, our system can adjust the voxel resolution automatically according to indoors or outdoors, improving the system performance in mixed environments. Moreover, we design a dynamic initialization for the adaptive voxel grid filter. The initial voxel size is set from coarse to fine with computational efficiency as feedback.
